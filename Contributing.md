### Guidelines for contributing to the frontend of scribble(Angular):
- Fork the repo.
- Clone it onto your local machine and make sure you have npm and angular-cli installed on your system.
- Open the 'scribble-app' folder in vscode.
- Remove the route guards in the file app-routing.module.ts.
- Make changes and run the app using the command ng-serve.
- Make valid PRs instead of spamming the repo.
- While raising a PR, make sure you have tested all of your changes on local and it's always a good practice to attach some proof of work like a screenshot to the PR and tag the issue which is addressed in that PR.
- If you have any doubts, make sure to discuss it with the author and get it clarified.
